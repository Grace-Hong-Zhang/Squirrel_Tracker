## What is it?

Squirrel Tracker Django project for Tools for Analytics course

We are two students at Columbia Univerisity, and we have created a Django app which can be used to track squirrels' locations and behaviours in NYC Central Park. The data used in the app was imported from the [2018 Central Park Squirrel Census Data.](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw)
